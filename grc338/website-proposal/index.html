            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>The target audience of this company is young people interested in clean and natural beauty products that both enhance their physical appearance but are also interested in sustainability because of this brand’s focus on use of natural ingredients and environmentally conscious packaging.</p>
           
            <p>Their primary goal when shopping here is to receive products that are both high quality and aesthetic in appearance, but also have environmental impact in mind. The products themselves will be advertised to be made with clean and natural ingredients so customers can trust they are not putting anything toxic or chemical on their skin, but they can also feel confident about using products that can be recycled or reused so their waste won’t negatively affect the environment.</p>
